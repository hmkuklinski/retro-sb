<b>Track 1: Dot-Com Boom</b>

Take an existing company / brand and give it a 90s-style website makeover.

This project was originally created using HTML/CSS/JS, my re-hack was created with React.

## Sidebar Links
These sections can provide links to different information sections or to various menu items. You can either click the individual links to bring up the page you'd like to view, or you can select the sidebar section's title!

To view the menu items, simply click the tab that has the menu item type you'd like to view.

Simply click the hamburger menu icon in the right corner of the screen to open the popup menu.

Then click on the selection you'd like to make.

## Viewing Seasonal Items
While you can go to /seasonal to get all the seasonal items, most of the seasonal items will be broken down by section. They are not shown by default, so you'll need to click the button to be redirected to the desired section.

After you finish viewing the seasonal items, the button will redirect you back to your original page. In this case, I started on the Refreshers page, so it will redirect me to the signature refreshers.

## Focused View

In the case of a page with many subcategories, you are able to click on the header of each section to view just the menu items in that category. Note that the header will turn green on hover if you are able to navigate to the subsection.

The redirect will send you back to the seasonal page.
