Through programs such as Starbucks Community Champions, Giving Match and The Starbucks Foundationâ€™s Neighborhood Grants, we empower partners (employees) to build sustained local impact by volunteering with nonprofit organizations that serve our communities. From Miami to Los Angeles, from Seattle to New York City, efforts this year included revitalizing public schools, packing meals, cleaning up streets, providing resources for houseless neighbors and even supporting student film projects. Inspired by the volunteerism and service of our partners, The Starbucks Foundation donated gift cards to more than 5,000 non-profit organizations across North America to fuel volunteers in advancing their missions.
