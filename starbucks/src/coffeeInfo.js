Our first store sold whole-bean coffee, tea and spices. Ever since then, Starbucks decided to transform into a complete coffee adventure. We started with traditional coffee classics, and slowly started to introduce specialty drinks and hand-crafted beverages that explore various flavor profiles. Today, Starbucks serves Frappuccino blended beverages in all of its 66 countries and offers more than 36,000 different drink combinations."},

We developed Coffee and Farmer Equity (C.A.F.E.) Practices, one of the coffee industry's first ethical sourcing guidelines. C.A.F.E. Practices is a set of more than 200 checkpoints in categories like economic transparency, social responsibility, environmental leadership and quality – all audited through a third-party independent verification process."},

The only two flavors were Coffee and Mocha, made from ice double-strength brewed Italian Roast coffee brewed in stores. There was not even whipped cream. Starbucks continued to innovate with new flavors to meet growing demand. In 1999, Starbucks introduced Caramel Frappuccino® blended beverage with whipped cream and caramel drizzle – served with a green straw and domed lid for the first time."},
